### üîç **Key Questions Explored:**  
- Does **stress** affect **sleep hours** and **work-life balance**?  
- How is **BMI** related to **daily steps, food intake, and exercise**?

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

### üîπ **1. Correlation Analysis**  
A **heatmap** reveals the relationships between key lifestyle variables.  

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title("Correlation Heatmap")
plt.show()
